# My First Project

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This project is designed for processing parallelepiped data, calculating their characteristics, and generating HTML reports. It loads data from a JSON file, computes characteristics (such as volume and surface area), generates statistics, and creates reports in HTML format.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
### ðŸ”¹ Cloning the Repository
To clone this repository to your computer, run the following command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/zhanar733/My_first_project.git
cd My_first_roject
```



## ðŸ›  Usage
1. **Prepare the Data**: Place the JSON file containing parallelepiped data into the `json_files` folder.
2. **Run the Program**: Execute the following command:
```sh
python main.py
```
3. **Results**: After execution, the following files will be created in the repository:
   - ðŸ“„ `json_files/characteristics.json` â€“ a file containing the characteristics of the parallelepipeds
   - ðŸ“Š `json_files/statistics.json` â€“ a file containing statistical data
   - ðŸ–¥ `html_files/` â€“ a folder containing HTML reports:
     - `characteristics.html` â€“ a table of parallelepiped characteristics
     - `statistics.html` â€“ a report with statistical data

## ðŸ“Š Features
âœ… Load parallelepiped data from a JSON file  
âœ… Calculate characteristics (volume, surface area, etc.)  
âœ… Generate statistics based on characteristics  
âœ… Automatically save data in JSON and HTML formats  
âœ… Create HTML reports for easy result visualization  

## ðŸ”§ Possible Improvements
ðŸ”¹ Add error handling for data loading  
ðŸ”¹ Improve the visual design of HTML reports  
ðŸ”¹ Support additional input formats (CSV, XML)  
ðŸ”¹ Develop a user interface for better interaction
